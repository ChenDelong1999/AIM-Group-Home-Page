- **2022-07-08**. Our [comprehensive survey](publication/aire2022deep/) on Deep Learning Based Single Sample Per Person Face Recognition is now published in [*Artificial Intelligence Review*](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10462-022-10240-2) (Impact Factor=9.588). 
<br /><br />
- **2022-06-23**. Our paper [_"Prototypical Contrastive Language Image Pretraining"_](publication/arxiv2022prototypical/) is finished at Megvii Technology. The [[preprint]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.10996) and [[codes]](https://github.com/megvii-research/protoclip) are now available. We developed a prototype-based approach for improved vision language pretraining, which achieved an +5.81% ImageNet linear probing improvement and an +2.01% ImageNet zero-shot classification improvement compared to CLIP.

- **2022-03-10**. Our paper [_"Self-Supervised Music Motion Synchronization Learning for Music-Driven Conducting Motion Generation"_](publication/jcst2022self/) is accepted by SCI (and CCF-B) indexed journal [Journal of Computer Science and Technology (JCST)](https://www.springer.com/journal/11390). The [ConductorMotion100](https://github.com/ChenDelong1999/VirtualConductor) dataset has been made public as a track of [The 1st Prospective Cup Meta-Intelligent Data Challenge](http://prospective.tocenet.org/)（首届国际“远见杯”元智能数据挑战大赛）hold by [Jiangsu Computer Society](https://www.jscs.org.cn/x1.php?id=770)（江苏省计算机学会）.
