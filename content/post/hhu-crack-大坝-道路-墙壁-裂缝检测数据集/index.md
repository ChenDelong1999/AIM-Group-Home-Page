title: HHU-Crack 大坝/道路/墙壁 裂缝检测数据集
date: 2023-01-26T13:10:51.847Z
summary: >
  HHU-crack-dam includes 288 training images and 83 testing images. he images
  are collected from the daily dam monitoring of high arch dams. This dataset is
  very challenging since there are lots of complex noise in the image. The
  difference between cracks and background is small, making it more difficult to
  distinguish. To our best knowledge, HHU-Crack-dam dataset is the first crack
  detection dataset for dams.


  HU-crack-wall includes 124 training images and 43 testing images. Some images have less interference and cleaner environments, while some others are in noisy background.


  HHU-crack-road includes 114 training images and 81 testing images. Though there are fewer noise interference, it is more imbalanced compared to HHU-crack-dam and HHU-crack-wall.
