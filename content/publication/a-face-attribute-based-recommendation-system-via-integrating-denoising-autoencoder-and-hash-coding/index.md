abstract: Nowadays, with the rapid development of commerce, how to effectively
  improve the performance of an recommendation system has aroused great concern.
  However, traditional recommendation system requires users to log in their
  accounts, which brings poor user experience. This paper presents a novel
  recommendation system by using face recognition technologies to extract face
  attribute information as the input automatically. The system first obtains the
  user information of identity, gender, age, and then gets feedback by
  expression analysis. Based on the acquired face attributes, we propose to
  extract compact binary user features by integrating denoising autoencoder and
  hash coding, which can effectively improve the computing efficiency.The hash
  features from DAE-H-Face and DAE are further combined to enhance the
  representation ability. Finally, Hamming similarity-based collaborative
  filtering is used for recommendation. Experimental results on the MovieLens
  database show that the proposed recommendation method has better effectiveness
  and robustness. Moreover, the results also demonstrate its advantages to the
  cold start problem.
