abstract: A convolutional neural network (CNN) is one of the most significant
  networks in the deep learning field. Since CNN made impressive achievements in
  many areas, including but not limited to computer vision and natural language
  processing, it attracted much attention from both industry and academia in the
  past few years. The existing reviews mainly focus on CNNâ€™s applications in
  different scenarios without considering CNN from a general perspective, and
  some novel ideas proposed recently are not covered. In this review, we aim to
  provide some novel ideas and prospects in this fast-growing field. Besides,
  not only 2-D convolution but also 1-D and multidimensional ones are involved.
  First, this review introduces the history of CNN. Second, we provide an
  overview of various convolutions. Third, some classic and advanced CNN models
  are introduced; especially those key points making them reach state-of-the-art
  results. Fourth, through experimental analysis, we draw some conclusions and
  provide several rules of thumb for functions and hyperparameter selection.
  Fifth, the applications of 1-D, 2-D, and multidimensional convolution are
  covered. Finally, some open issues and promising directions for CNN are
  discussed as guidelines for future work.
