title: "Deep Learning Based Single Sample Per Person Face Recognition: A Survey"
abstract: "Face recognition has long been an active research area in the field
  of artificial intelligence, particularly since the rise of deep learning in
  recent years. In some practical situations, each identity has only a single
  sample available for training. Face recognition under this situation is
  referred to as single sample face recognition and poses significant challenges
  to the effective training of deep models. Therefore, in recent years,
  researchers have attempted to unleash more potential of deep learning and
  improve the model recognition performance in the single sample situation.
  While several comprehensive surveys have been conducted on traditional single
  sample face recognition approaches, emerging deep learning based methods are
  rarely involved in these reviews. Accordingly, we focus on the deep
  learning-based methods in this paper, classifying them into virtual sample
  methods and generic learning methods. In the former category, virtual images
  or virtual features are generated to benefit the training of the deep model.
  In the latter one, additional multi-sample generic sets are used. There are
  three types of generic learning methods: combining traditional methods and
  deep features, improving the loss function, and improving network structure,
  all of which are covered in our analysis. Moreover, we review face datasets
  that have been commonly used for evaluating single sample face recognition
  models and go on to compare the results of different types of models.
  Additionally, we discuss problems with existing single sample face recognition
  methods, including identity information preservation in virtual sample
  methods, domain adaption in generic learning methods. Furthermore, we regard
  developing unsupervised methods is a promising future direction, and point out
  that the semantic gap as an important issue that needs to be further
  considered."
