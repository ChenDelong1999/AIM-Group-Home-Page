title: Significant Wave Height Prediction based on Wavelet Graph Neural Network
abstract: Computational intelligence-based ocean characteristics forecasting
  applications, such as Significant Wave Height (SWH) prediction, are crucial
  for avoiding social and economic loss in coastal cities. Compared to the
  traditional empirical-based or numerical-based forecasting models, "soft
  computing" approaches, including machine learning and deep learning models,
  have shown numerous success in recent years. In this paper, we focus on
  enabling the deep learning model to learn both short-term and long-term
  spatial-temporal dependencies for SWH prediction. A Wavelet Graph Neural
  Network (WGNN) approach is proposed to integrate the advantages of wavelet
  transform and graph neural network. Several parallel graph neural networks are
  separately trained on wavelet decomposed data, and the reconstruction of each
  model’s prediction forms the final SWH prediction. Experimental results show
  that the proposed WGNN approach outperforms other models, including the
  numerical models, the machine learning models, and several deep learning
  models.
