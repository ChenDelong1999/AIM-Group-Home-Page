title: "Let AI Perform Better Next Time — A Systematic Review of Medical
  Imaging-based Automated Diagnosis of COVID-19: 2020-2022"
abstract: "The pandemic of COVID-19 has caused millions of infections, which has
  led to a great loss all over the world, socially and economically. Due to the
  false-negative rate and the time-consuming characteristic of the Reverse
  Transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) tests, diagnosing based on
  X-ray images and Computed Tomography (CT) images have been widely adopted to
  confirm positive COVID-19 RT-PCR tests. Since the very beginning of the
  pandemic, researchers in the artificial intelligence area have proposed a
  large number of automatic diagnosing models, hoping to assist radiologists and
  improve diagnosing accuracy. However, after two years of development, there
  are still few models that can be actually applied in real-world scenarios.
  Numerous problems have emerged in the research of automated diagnosis of
  COVID-19. In this paper, we present a systematic review of these diagnosing
  models. A total of 179 proposed models are involved. First, we compare the
  medical image modalities (CT or X-ray) for COVID-19 diagnosis from both the
  clinical perspective and the artificial intelligence perspective. Then, we
  classify existing methods into two types -- image-level diagnosis (i.e.,
  classification-based methods) and pixel-level diagnosis (i.e.,
  segmentation-based models). For both types of methods, we define universal
  model pipelines and analyze the techniques that have been applied in each step
  of the pipeline in detail. In addition, we also review some commonly adopted
  public COVID-19 datasets. More importantly, we present an in-depth discussion
  of the existing automated diagnosis models and note a total of three
  significant problems: biased model performance evaluation; inappropriate
  implementation details; and low reproducibility, reliability, and
  explainability. For each point, we give corresponding recommendations on how
  can we avoid making the same mistakes and let AI do better in the next
  pandemic. "
