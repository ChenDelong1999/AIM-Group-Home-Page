abstract: This paper proposes a commodity text classification-based e-commerce
  category and attribute mining method. The fastText is utilized to classify the
  commodity text data and establish the first-level and leaf category mapping
  between two different e-commerce platforms. Based on the category mapping, the
  system can mine the attributes and attributes' values that the target leaf
  category does not have, while its corresponding leaf category from another
  platform does. Additionally, the longest common subsequence (LCS) algorithm is
  utilized to calculate the attribute similarity. The experiments on two
  different e-commerce platforms show that the proposed method not only can help
  the e-commerce platform establish and improve the category architecture but
  also enhances user experience.
