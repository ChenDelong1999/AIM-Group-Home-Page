abstract: Single sample face recognition (FR) uses only one image per person for
  training. It is a challenging task due to insufficient training samples and
  dramatic variance of unseen images in real applications. In this paper, we
  propose a cycle-autoencoder model to generate facial variation from the single
  training sample and remove the variation in the testing set. Our approach
  adopts a cycle consistency scheme to formulate the generation and removal
  models in one framework. Considering the prior structure of the images
  produced from the generation and removal models, we further propose a
  block-sparse joint representation method, which integrates the representation
  procedure of all testing samples and obtains all the coefficients
  simultaneously. The experimental results on AR, Extended Yale B and CUFS
  datasets not only demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method, but
  also represent its robustness to complex facial variations. Experiments on the
  CUFS dataset also show that our approach is appropriate for sketch face
  recognition with single sample per person.
