title: A Review of Driver Fatigue Detection and Its Advances on the Use of RGB-D
  Camera and Deep Learning
abstract: Driver fatigue is an essential reason for traffic accidents, which
  poses a severe threat to people's lives and property. In this review, we
  summarize the latest research findings and analyze the developmental trends of
  driver fatigue detection. Firstly, we analyze and discuss four types of
  different fatigue detection technologies based on driver physiological
  signals, behavior features, vehicle running features, and information fusion,
  respectively. Then, we focus on  RGB-D camera and deep learning which are two
  state-of-the-art solutions in this field. Finally, we present the work on
  integration of RGB-D camera and deep learning, where Generative Adversarial
  Networks and multi-channel schemes are utilized to enhance the performance. We
  conducted experiments to show that the fatigue features extracted by
  Convolutional Neural Networks are superior to traditional handcrafted ones
  while single features cannot guarantee robustness. Moreover, the latent
  fatigue features extracted by deep learning methods have been demonstrated to
  be effective for fatigue detection.
