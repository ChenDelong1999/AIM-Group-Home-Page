title: "MEP-3M: A Large-scale Multi-modal E-Commerce Products Dataset"
abstract: "The product categories are vital for the e-commerce platforms due to
  the core applications on automatic product category assignment, personalized
  product recommendations, etc. Two key aspects of product classification are
  multi-modal information and fine-grained understanding. However, recent
  datasets could hardly support both sides. To address this issue, in this
  paper, we construct a large-scale Multi-modal E-commerce Products
  classification dataset MEP-3M, which consists of over 3 million products and
  599 fine-grained product categories. Each product is represented with an
  image-text pair and annotated with hierarchical labels. To our best knowledge,
  MEP-3M is the first e-commerce products dataset paying attention to the
  multi-modal and fine-grained aspects concurrently, and its scale achieves the
  largest in existing E-commerce datasets. We also present the performances of
  the several methods on this dataset as the baselines, where the best accuracy
  achieves 90.70%. This dataset is now available at https:
