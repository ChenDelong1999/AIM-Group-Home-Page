abstract: In this demo, we present the _VirtualConductor_, a system that can generate conducting video from a given piece of music and a single user's image. First, a large-scale conductor motion dataset is collected and constructed. Then, we propose an Audio Motion Correspondence Network (AMCNet) and adversarial-perceptual learning to learn the cross-modal relationship and generate diverse, plausible, music-synchronized motion. Finally, we combine 3D animation rendering and a pose transfer model to synthesize conducting video from a single given user's image. Therefore, any user can become a virtual conductor through the _VirtualConductor_ system.
