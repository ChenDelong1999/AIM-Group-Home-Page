title: Weakly Correlated Adversarial Learning for Cognitive Diagnosis System
abstract: In traditional cognitive diagnosis models, the representations of
  students and questions tend to have a high correlation. It results in biases
  and poor performance in real-world applications. In order to weaken such
  correlation, we propose a Weakly Correlated Adversarial Learning (WCAL)
  method. Based on WCAL, we design a cognitive system for both student knowledge
  state evaluation and exam results prediction which can help teachers select
  exams suitable for students. The experimental results show the proposed method
  can effectively model students' knowledge state and help teachers improve the
  teaching effect.
