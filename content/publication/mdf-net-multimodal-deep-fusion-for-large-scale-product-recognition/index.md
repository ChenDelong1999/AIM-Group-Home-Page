abstract: Large-scale production recognition systems are crucial for building
  efficient E-commerce platforms. However, various traditional product
  recognition approaches are based on single-modal data input (e.g., image or
  text), which limits recognition performance. To tackle this issue, in this
  paper, we propose a Multimodal Deep Fusion Network (MDF-Net) for accurate
  large-scale product recognition. The MDF-Net has a two-stream late fusion
  architecture, with a CNN model and a bi-directional language model that
  respectively extract semantic latent features from multimodal inputs. Image
  and text features are fused via Hadamard product, then jointly generate
  results. Further, we investigated the integration of attention mechanism and
  residual connection to respectively improve the text and image
  representations. We conduct experiments on a large-scale multimodal E-commerce
  product dataset MEP-3M, which consists of three million image-text product
  data. MDF-Net achieves a 93.72% classification accuracy over 599 fine-grained
  classes. Empirical results demonstrated that the MDF-Net yields better
  performance than traditional approaches.
