title: Asymmetric Exponential Loss Function for Crack Segmentation
abstract: Real-time and effective crack detection on public facilities is
  significant in maintaining the facilities even saving lives. Recent methods
  mostly explore the impact of model structures but neglect the impact from the
  loss functions. In this paper, we concentrate on analyzing the loss functions
  during the training process of crack segmentation tasks and propose an
  Asymmetric Exponential Loss Function~(AELF) that addresses two key challenges,
  sample biases and dataset biases. For the sample biases, AELF adopts an
  exponential loss function, thus can assign higher weights to the "hard"
  samples, making the models concentrate on the crack details. For the dataset
  biases, AELF leverages asymmetric protocol to balance the inevitable False
  Positive and False Negative samples. We conduct extensive experiments on three
  datasets of road, dam, and wall collected from real scenes. The impressive
  performances reveal the effectiveness of our proposed Asymmetric Exponential
  Loss Function.
