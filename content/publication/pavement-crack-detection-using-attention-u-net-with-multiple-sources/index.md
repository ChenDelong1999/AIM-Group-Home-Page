abstract: The detection of road cracks is the main basis of highway maintenance,
  and the noise, shadows, and irregularities of road images will bring great
  challenges to traditional detection. Therefore, we propose a multi-source
  attention U-net network, which can effectively avoid these interferences and
  get satisfactory results. In this method, we use transfer learning to make up
  for the lack of data, then use the U-net add attention mechanism to increase
  the weights of the cracks, and finally get more accurate results through model
  fusion. To prove the effectiveness of the method, we verify it by comparative
  experiments, and the experimental results show that the proposed approach is
  superior to the state of the art method in crack detection task.
