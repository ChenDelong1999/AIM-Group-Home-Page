abstract: Due to the semantic gap between the insufficient facial features and
  facial identifying information, the single sample per person (SSPP) problem
  has always been a significant challenge in the field of facial recognition. To
  address this problem, this paper proposes a Self-Organizing Map (SOM)-based
  binary coding (SOM-BC) method, which extracts the middle-level semantic
  features by merging the SOM network with the Bag-of-Features (BoF) model.
  First, we extract the local features of the facial images using the SIFT
  descriptor. Next, inspired by human visual perception, we utilize a SOM neural
  network to obtain a visual words dictionary capable of reflecting the
  intrinsic structure of facial features in semantic space. Subsequently, a
  binary coding method is further proposed to map the local features into
  semantic space. Finally, we propose a simple but effective similarity measure
  method for classification. Experimental results on three public databases not
  only demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, but also its high
  computational efficiency.
