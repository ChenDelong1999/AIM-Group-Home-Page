abstract: In this article, we propose a uniform generic representation (UGR)
  method to solve the single sample per person (SSPP) problem in face
  recognition, which aims to find consistency between the global and local
  generic representations. For the local generic representation, we require the
  probe patches of the same image to be constructed respectively by the
  corresponding patches of the same gallery image and the intra-class variation
  dictionaries. Therefore, the probe patches' coefficients, corresponding to
  patch gallery dictionaries, should be similar to each other. For the global
  generic representation, the probe image's coefficient, corresponding to the
  gallery dictionary, should be similar to those of its probe patches. In order
  to meet the two requirements, we combine local generic representation with
  global generic representation in soft form. We obtain the representation
  coefficients by solving a simple quadratic optimization problem. UGR has been
  evaluated on Extended Yale B, AR, CMU-PIE, and LFW databases. Experimental
  results show the robustness and effectiveness of our method to illumination,
  expression, occlusion, time variation, and pose.

  caption: The illustration. Regardless of the intra-class variations, the probe
    image and its probe patches should be constructed respectively by the
    corresponding gallery image and its gallery patches, i.e., ideally, z=zi .
    Even if z≠zi , they should be similar.
